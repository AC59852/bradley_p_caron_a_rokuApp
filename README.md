# Roku Flashback

## Introduction
Thanks for checking us out, we're the authors behind Roku Flashback
<br>
Here you will find all of the files we used to create this site.

### What We're Doing
We were tasked to create a platform for Roku that allowed visitors to watch and listen to old Movies, Music and TV Shows
<br>
We curated a list of the top pieces of media in each respected field, that caters to all audiences.
<br>
We also made it family friendly, through a Kids profile, you and your kid can watch and listen to safe, family fun media 
<br>
But for Mom and Dad, you can choose to consume for graphic content as well, we've got you.
<br>
Check it out, and enjoy a long nostalgic trip down memory lane. Relive the classics and check out how great
<br>
times were before. What are you waiting for? Hop in the time machine and get started!

### Future Goals
Future plans for the site include curating a larger list of content for both adults and children.
<br>
We will be creating stricter viewing for Kids, making it harder for them to access graphic content.
<br>
We will be improving our backend, allowing for more users to be created, profiles to be made and edited
<br>
We also want to provide more interactivity. Allowing for video/audio clips on all movies, music and tv shows
